# CAPRICEP
An extended TSP (Time Stretched Pulse) that enables interactive and real-time measurement of the linear time-invariant, the non-linear time-invariant, and random and time varying responses simultaneously. This is the substantial revision of FVN and related tools. I will stop updating FVN.

All components are uploaded. Type "realTimeTester" to start the application. Supporting materials will be ready soon.

### Abstract

We introduce a new member of TSP (Time Stretched Pulse) for acoustic and speech measurement infrastructure, 
based on a simple all-pass filter and systematic randomization. 
This new infrastructure fundamentally upgrades our previous measurement procedure, 
which enables simultaneous measurement of multiple attributes, including non-linear ones
without requiring extra filtering nor post-processing. 
Our new proposal establishes a theoretically solid, flexible, and extensible foundation in acoustic measurement.
Moreover, it is general enough to provide versatile research tools for other fields, such as biological signal analysis.
We illustrate using acoustic measurements and data augmentation as representative examples among various prospective applications. 
We open-sourced MATLAB implementation. 
It consists of an interactive and real-time acoustic tool, MATLAB functions, and supporting materials.
Recently we introduced an interactive and real-time tool for measureing voice fundamental frequency response to auditory test signal with frequency modulation.

## Measurement of pitch extractors' response to FM test signal of simulated vowel /a/

Folder "fmResponseTester" consists of the tester. The following command tests MATLAB's pitch extractor function "pitch.m" using a test signal with 240 Hz pitch and 1 cent modulation depth. The output reports (graphics and MATLAB data) are stored on the current working directory. The last argument "@pitchNCF" is a function pointer to the interface program (user has to write) for the target pitch extractor (a MATLAB function "pitch.m").

    ncfOut = fmTransfTestGaussN(240, 1, pwd, @pitchNCF)
  
For technical details refer the following.

Use "capResultReporter" for visualize and report the measurement results

## Off-line acoustic measurement

Try:

    app = struct;
    app.CommonSignal = struct;
    devices = getAudioDevices(audioPlayerRecorder);
    [deviceID,tf] = listdlg('ListString',devices, 'SelectionMode','single');
    if tf
        app.CommonSignal.DeviceName = devices{deviceID};
        app.DeviceLabel.Text = devices{deviceID};
        fs = 44100;
        app.CommonSignal.Reader = audioPlayerRecorder(fs,"RecorderChannelMapping", 1, ...
            "BitDepth", "24-bit integer", "Device", devices{deviceID});
        app.DriverLabel.Text = 'simultaneousIO'; %get(app.CommonSignal.Reader,"Driver");
        tResponse = 400;
        nRepetition = 30;
        outChannel = 'L-ch';
        option.calibrationConst = 200;
        inChannel = 1;
        option.DeviceName = devices{deviceID};
        analysisStr = capricepResponseTest(fs, tResponse, nRepetition, ...
            outChannel, inChannel, 'acoustic_system', option);
        analysisStrCore = struct;
        analysisStrCore.yRecorded = analysisStr.yRecorded;
        analysisStrCore.pinkLPC = analysisStr.pinkLPC;
        analysisStrCore.fs = fs;
        analysisStrCore.tResponse = analysisStr.tResponse;
        analysisStrCore.nRepetition = analysisStr.nRepetition;
        analysisStrCore.outChannel = analysisStr.outChannel;
        analysisStrCore.numChannels = analysisStr.numChannels;
        analysisStrCore.selectedChannels = analysisStr.selectedChannels;
        analysisStrCore.lAeq = analysisStr.lAeq;
        analysisStrCore.calibrationConst = analysisStr.calibrationConst;
        app.CommonSignal.outPath = ".";
        fname = "test";
        save(app.CommonSignal.outPath + "/" + fname, "analysisStrCore");
        tmp = capResultReporter([char(app.CommonSignal.outPath)   '/'  char(fname)], 'NONE');
      end
    
For usual room, tResponse = 400; provides better result in the low-frequency end. 800 is better for a classroom.
